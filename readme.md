# Requirements
scipy version >= 1.15.3
numpy version >= 2.2.6
matplotlib version >= 3.10.6

# Running the code
The project's main code is split up between the ODE and the definite integral, into main\_ODE.py and main\_int.py, respectively. Running either file will produce all of the plots for that problem which are included in the report.
